# ifsun
**ifsun** is a nice little linux command line tool for people like me who are obsessed over checking sunrise/sunset time for the day.

#### Background
If you had lived in Seattle, USA you would know why this tool would be appreciated: In the months November to January the sun sets before 5.00PM and Seattlites typically are eagerly waiting for that day to arrive when its 5:01PM and sun has still not set. Trust me, it is WAY depressing if it is dark both when you get to work and when you get home.
